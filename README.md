I'm a recent graduate of Dartmouth College, with a BA in Physics modified with Computer Science and a minor in Chinese language. In my time at Dartmouth, I cultivated a strong interest in Quantum Computing, especially in its potential uses in drug discovery and materials science more broadly. I am looking to expand my knowledge of current computational drug discovery, using Machine Learning and AI-powered decision making to improve the design and discovery process.

I’m enthusiastic about solving problems, using my analytic and computational skills to approach a problem from many angles. My coursework at Dartmouth reflects my problem-solving interest, including field-specific classes in quantum mechanics and quantum computing as well as courses on the tools to tackle them, like physical computing and machine learning. I thrive most when given a hard problem and the freedom to solve it, whether that problem is a physics problem set, a tricky design consideration, or a giant rock that needs to be moved. (See my work with the Appalachian Mountain Club.) I also love to work in teams, working alongside teammates to create new solutions or leading them to solutions I’ve already found.
