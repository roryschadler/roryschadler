## About Me

I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in applying AI and other
computational tools to tackle interesting problems. I'm especially interested in
using AI, quantum computers, and classical computing techniques _together_ to
improve the drug discovery process.

I'm currently working as a software engineer II for Flagship Labs 97, an
early-stage startup in Boston, Massachusetts. FL97 is aiming to automate the
scientific process, allowing materials scientists and biochemists to design,
build, and analyze new materials and molecules faster than ever before. I'm
building the platform that will enable this automation, and I'm excited to be a
part of this effort.

I've found scientists often get slowed down by the applications they use. My
experience has taught me that the best tools get out of the way, allowing
scientists to focus on their work, while supporting communication and
collaboration among them. I have experience building and deploying applications
that scientists can actually use, as well as experience working with those
scientists to improve existing workflows and tools. I've built web apps using
React and Vue, backend services in Python, Node, and Go, and I've deployed them
on Kubernetes clusters on AWS, Azure, and on-premise infrastructure.

Most of all, Iâ€™m enthusiastic about solving problems, using my analytic and
computational skills to approach a problem from many angles. I'm a Dartmouth
College graduate, and my coursework in quantum mechanics and quantum computing
provided the problems to solve, while courses on software design and
implementation, physical computing, and machine learning provided the tools to
tackle them. I thrive most when given a hard problem and the freedom to solve
it.
