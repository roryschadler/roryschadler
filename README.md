## About Me

I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in helping industry apply quantum
computing tools to tackle interesting problems. I'm especially interested in
using quantum and classical computing _together_ to improve the drug discovery
process. I have experience building and deploying applications to help people do
just that, building web apps using React and Vue, building backend services
written in Node, Python, and Go, and deploying them all as Kubernetes
applications. I am looking to expand my knowledge of current computational drug
discovery techniques.

I'm currently working as a front-end software engineer for Zapata Computing, in
Boston, Massachusetts. As part of the Quantum Platform team, I contribute to
Orquestra across the tech stack, writing and deploying high-performance user
interfaces for use by scientists and non-scientists alike. Orquestra enables
anyone to write and deliver quantum and machine learning solutions, and run them
in an enterprise environment.

Iâ€™m enthusiastic about solving problems, using my analytic and computational
skills to approach a problem from many angles. I'm also a Dartmouth College
graduate, and my coursework while at Dartmouth reflects that problem-solving
interest: field-specific courses in quantum mechanics and quantum computing,
which provide the problems to solve, as well as classes on software design and
implementation, physical computing, and machine learning, which provide the
tools to tackle them. I thrive most when given a hard problem and the freedom to
solve it, whether that problem is a tricky design consideration, implementing a
quantum algorithm, or a giant rock that needs to be moved. (See my volunteer
work with the Appalachian Mountain Club.)
