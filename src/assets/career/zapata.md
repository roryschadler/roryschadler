# Zapata AI, Platform Engineer

## March 2022 - Present

At [Zapata AI](https://zapata.ai), I contribute in several capacities across the
tech stack and the organization, writing Platform microservices in Go,
client-facing full-stack applications in TypeScript, and internal DevOps tools
using Python. My projects include:

- The [Orquestra Platform](https://orquestra.io), an all-inclusive environment
  for building, testing, and deploying Generative AI-enhanced applications.

  - Orquestra Portal, a browser-based tool to collaboratively run and manage
    remote workflows
  - Orquestra Studio, a companion tool to the Portal, for writing and testing
    those workflows before submission

- The Andretti Autosport | Zapata AI Race Analytics Command Center, an
  extension of the Orquestra Platform on Andretti's trackside engineering truck
  - Live race data ingestion, cleaning, and processing, and streaming model
    inference
  - High-performance dashboards to support race strategy
