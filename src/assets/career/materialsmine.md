[MaterialsMine](https://materialsmine.org/) is an open-source repository for
nanocomposite and mechanical materials data which leverages the [RDF data
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) to encode
knowledge and relationships in a computationally accessible way. While on the
team, I worked in two different capacities:

- As a frontend engineer, I helped to rebuild and containerize the Vue.js
  frontend, creating a production-ready application.
- As an intern, I helped in the development of the backend RDF database. I wrote
  tools for semantic data ETL, retrieving and transforming data and metadata
  from academic publications and loading it into the
  [Whyis](https://whyis.readthedocs.io/) knowledge graph
