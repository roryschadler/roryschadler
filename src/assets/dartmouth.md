# Dartmouth College

I'm a proud Dartmouth College alumnus! I graduated cum laude with a BA in Physics modified with Computer Science, and a Minor in Chinese Language. I was a member of the Dartmouth Dodecaphonics, the Dartmouth College Glee Club, and the Handel Society. When I wasn't studying or singing, I worked for the Theater Department, as a stage carpenter and electrician.
