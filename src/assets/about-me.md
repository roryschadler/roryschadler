I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in applying AI and other
computational tools to improve drug and materials discovery. Well-designed and
powerful software can accelerate scientific discovery by enabling communication
and collaboration both between scientists, and between humans and machines. I do
my best work at that intersection of science and software, and enjoy building
tools for researchers that are both powerful and easy to use.

I'm currently working at [Lila Sciences](https://www.lila.ai/), a Flagship
Pioneering startup in Boston, Massachusetts. Lila's mission is to build
scientific superintelligence, to solve humankind's greatest challenges. We're
building a laboratory which will allow AI to explore the boundaries of
knowledge, and expand our understanding of the world. I'm excited to be a part
of this effort, building the platform that will enable this automation of the
scientific method.

At the end of the day, Iâ€™m enthusiastic about solving problems, using my
analytic and computational skills to approach problems from many angles. I
thrive most when given a hard problem and the chance to understand it, design a
solution, and tackle it.
