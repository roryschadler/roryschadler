# About Me

I'm a software engineer with a deep interest in helping industry
apply quantum computing tools to tackle interesting problems. I'm
especially interested in using quantum and classical computing
_together_ to improve the drug discovery process. I have
experience building and deploying applications to help people do just
that, building web apps using React and Vue, building backend services
written in TypeScript, Python, and Go, and deploying them all on Kubernetes clusters.

I'm currently working as a Platform Engineer for [Zapata AI](https://zapata.ai),
in Boston, Massachusetts. I work on both client- and internal-facing projects,
including dashboards and MLOps pipelines for the [Andretti Autosport | Zapata AI
Race Analytics Command Center](https://zapata.ai/case-study-andretti/),
as well as [Orquestra Portal and Studio](https://orquestra.io), Zapata's
platform for building Industrial Generative AI applications.

I am a proud Dartmouth graduate, with a degree in Physics modified with
Computer Science and a minor in Chinese language. I'm enthusiastic
about solving problems, using my analytic and computational skills to
approach a problem from many angles. I thrive most when given a hard
problem and the freedom to solve it, whether that problem is a tricky
design consideration, a quantum algorithm, or a giant rock that needs to
be moved. (Ask me about my volunteer work with the Appalachian Mountain
Club.)
