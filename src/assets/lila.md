## Senior Software Engineer, September 2025 - Present

At [Lila Sciences](https://www.lila.ai/), we're on a mission to build Scientific
Superintelligence, to solve humanity's biggest problems in science.

I'm currently working on our Lab-as-Software team, still building the orchestration
layer, data plane, and management plane for our lab. The tools I'm building support human
scientific development, as well as real-world, ground-truth feedback for our
SSI. I work across the software organization, as well as with our scientists and
engineers, to translate both human and AI scientific thought into automated
procedures.

I also support software practices across the organization, beyond the software
engineering team. I work closely with our automation team to support best
practices, and help to build and maintain our CI/CD pipeline.

## Software Engineer II, July 2024 - September 2025

As part of the Data and Compute Platform team, I worked on:

- A unified data plane for collecting, storing, and processing results produced
  by our laboratory instruments; tracking samples; and managing other
  operational lab data.
- The orchestration layer for running automated experiments, including
  scheduling, monitoring, and failure recovery.
