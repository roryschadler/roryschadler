# Lila Sciences, Software Engineer II

## July 2024 - Present

At [Lila Sciences](https://www.lila.ai/) (formerly FL97), I'm building the
platform for scientific superintelligence to drive the scientific method,
enabling scientists to design, build, and analyze new materials and molecules.

As part of the Data and Compute Platform team, I'm working on:

- A unified data plane for collecting, storing, and processing results produced
  by our laboratory instruments; tracking samples; and managing other
  operational lab data.
- The orchestration layer for running automated experiments, including
  scheduling, monitoring, and failure recovery.
